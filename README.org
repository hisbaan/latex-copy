* Description
This is a set of scripts that I use to copy LaTeX code from a proper editor (with my snippets) to my clipboard. Either as LaTeX code or as plain text with math symbols.
* Example
** latex-copy
<<<<<<< HEAD
#+MACRO: imglnk @@html:<a href="$1"><img src="$2"></a>@@

* Desclaimer
These scripts are not intended to have compatibility with other people's machines. They are only guaranteed to work with my exact setup and I have not written them to be explicitly used by others. If you would like to take these scripts and modify to suit your workflow then please, feel free.
