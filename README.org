* Description
This is a set of scripts that I use to copy LaTeX code from a proper editor (with my snippets) to my clipboard. Either as LaTeX code or as plain text with math symbols.
* Examples
** [[https://asciinema.org/a/380899][latex-copy]]
** latex-to-text
/In Progress/
** latex-pic
/Example In Progress, Script is finished/
* Desclaimer
These scripts are not intended to have compatibility with other people's machines. They are only guaranteed to work with my exact setup and I have not written them to be explicitly used by others. If you would like to take these scripts and modify to suit your workflow then please, feel free.
